# NUMBER-THEORY-CALCULATION-TOOLKIT
Number Theory Calculator

*OVERVIEW

A simple Python project that performs basic number theory operations such as GCD, prime generation, prime factorization, Armstrong number check, palindrome check, and Fibonacci sequence generation.

*FEATURES

GCD of two numbers

Prime numbers up to N

Prime factorization

Armstrong number check

Palindrome check

Fibonacci series



*TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python (Standard Library only)


*HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN

Download the project folder.
Run the script using:
theorycalc.py

Follow the menu or commands in the program.


*Testing Instructions Test each feature manually by entering sample inputs:

GCD: 48 & 18 → Output: 6

Primes till N: 10 → Output: 2,3,5,7

Factorization: 360 → Output: 2³ × 3² × 5

Armstrong: 153 → True

Palindrome: 1221 → True

Fibonacci: terms = 6 → 0,1,1,2,3,5
